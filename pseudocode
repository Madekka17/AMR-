START

INITIALIZE camera stream
INITIALIZE motor controller (ROS2 publisher to /cmd_vel)
INITIALIZE object detection parameters (e.g., target color range)

LOOP while robot is powered ON:
    CAPTURE image frame from camera

    CONVERT image to HSV color space

    APPLY color threshold to isolate the target object

    FIND contours in the thresholded image

    IF contours are found:
        SELECT the largest contour (assumed to be the target)
        COMPUTE bounding box and center of the contour

        CALCULATE error_x = center_x - (image_width / 2)

        IF abs(error_x) > threshold:
            IF error_x > 0:
                TURN robot right (set negative angular velocity)
            ELSE:
                TURN robot left (set positive angular velocity)
        ELSE:
            SET angular velocity to 0 (robot is aligned)

        MOVE robot forward with constant linear speed

    ELSE:
        STOP robot (no object found)

    DISPLAY the processed image (optional for debugging)

END LOOP

SHUTDOWN camera and stop all motors
